6,3/7/26,Strade Bianche,65,989,87,Climb,https://tpvirtualhub.com/62164,"Born in 2007, Strade Bianche has rapidly ascended from a novelty event to a cornerstone of the professional spring calendar. The route is defined by Tuscany’s rolling hills and the grueling sterrati farm tracks. Key sectors like Monte Sante Marie offer relentless 18% gradients, while the limestone dust creates a technical, low-traction test of endurance.

On the chalky gravel, rouleurs utilize their raw power to maintain high momentum through flat, vibrating sectors. Puncheurs wait for the sharp, explosive ramps like Colle Pinzuto to launch decisive surges, hoping to gap rivals before the asphalt returns. Climbers eventually take control on the brutal final wall of Via Santa Caterina, where weight-to-power ratios dictate the winner."
7,3/14/26,Grand Prix de Denain - Porte du Hainaut,79,521,7,Sprint,https://tpvirtualhub.com/62166,"The Grand Prix de Denain carries significant weight as a historical pillar of the Coupe de France, established in 1959. Traditionally a high-speed battle through the Nord department’s industrial heart, the route features a series of punishing, punchy ascents. Without the typical cobblestones, the relentless wind and sharp gradients become the primary architects of the day's selection.

On this tarmac-only course, rouleurs will drive a ferocious pace on the flat, exposed stretches to fatigue the pure sprinters. Puncheurs must time their explosions perfectly on the 11.4% ramps to force a breakaway, while climbers will struggle to maintain gaps on the fast descents. Every rider must fight for positioning before the narrow, twisting finish in Denain."
